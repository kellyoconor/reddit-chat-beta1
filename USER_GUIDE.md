## Understanding Results

The AI will analyze Reddit posts and provide:

2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Whether posts are generally positive, negative, or neutral
3. **Common Issues**: Categorization of problems (billing, service, equipment, etc.)
4. **Geographic Patterns**: If location information is available
5. **Suggested Solutions**: Based on community responses

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Specific**: Ask about particular issues rather than very general questions
2. **Specify Timeframes**: Mention if you want recent or historical information
3. **Follow Up**: Ask for more details about specific aspects of the initial response
4. **Request Solutions**: Specifically ask for solutions if you're troubleshooting
5. **Compare Issues**: Ask how current issues compare to past problems

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the Reddit Analyzer:

1. **No Response**: Ensure both frontend and backend servers are running
2. **Error Messages**: Check that the OpenAI API key is properly configured
3. **Slow Responses**: Complex queries analyzing many posts may take longer
4. **Limited Data**: The analyzer can only access publicly available Reddit posts
5. **Refresh the Page**: If the interface becomes unresponsive, try refreshing
